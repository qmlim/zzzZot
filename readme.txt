5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
Download the following dependencies: 

--Aim for no more than two sentences for each of the following questions.--


6. Did you design your app with a particular type of user in mind? If so, whom?
We designed it in general for anyone. Mainly developed with the emulation of the Samsung Galaxy A51/71 and used colors that reminded us of UCI.


7. Did you design your app specifically for iOS or Android, or both?
Usable for anyone but mainly following the type of navigation found in an android app.


8. How can a person log overnight sleep in your app? Why did you choose to support logging overnight sleep in this way?
Click the bottom left clock icon titled, Log Sleep Time, this will open up a window with two scrolling option bars allowing you to choose both a bedtime and wake date/time. Then simmply click the Log Sleep button, this is a user friendly convention easy for anyone who has had any experience with android apps.


9. How can a person log sleepiness during the day in your app? Why did you choose to support logging sleepiness in this way?
Navigate to the Log Sleepiness tab using the bottom right battery icon, select a start and end time, click the log sleep button, and after selecting a level simply click log sleepiness. This follows the same convention as the perivous log sleep time which will help keep uniformity.


10. How can a person view the data they logged in your app? Why did you choose to support viewing logged data in this way?
A user must navigate to the home screen and select one of two buttons coresponding to the type of logged data they wish to see. We chose this because this method is space efficent in terms of noise on the page.


11. Which feature choose--using a native device resource, backing up logged data, or both?
We are using backing up logged data by storing logged data into a json file.


12. If you used a native device resource, what feature did you add? How does this feature change the app's experience for a user?
N.A.


13. If you backed up logged data, where does it back up to?
The logged data is backed up to a local .json database using @capacitor/preferences.


14. How does your app implement or follow principles of good mobile design?
We have implemented back buttons, easy navigation, a visually appealing application, and have sized things to be easily identified/interacted with.
